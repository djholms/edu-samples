# PostgreSQL Administration Deep Dive

Welcome to the official repo for the Linux Academy "PostgreSQL Administration Deep Dive" course. Here you will find:

- The example database 'acweb'. This includes a backup of the database, a script to simply create the barebones structures for it, as well as scripts for loading it with mock data.
- Scripts for completing the hands-on labs associated with this course.
- Example files of commands for installing PostgreSQL on CentOS and Ubuntu.

I hope that this content is useful both for those in the course as well as anyone else wanting to start or continue learning PostgreSQL.

Happy learning!
